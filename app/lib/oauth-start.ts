 * writes it as a cookie; `/auth/callback` reads it back to trade the
 * authorization code for a session. Lose that cookie anywhere in between and
 * the callback fails saying the verifier is missing — which reads like a
 * misconfigured redirect URL and is not one.
 *
 * As a server action the write had to survive being attached to an action
 * response that then redirects off-site, through a client-side navigation and
 * a hosting layer, before the browser ever stored it. Here the verifier is set
 * on the very redirect that sends somebody to the provider: one response,
 * carrying both the destination and the cookie that will make the return trip
 * work.
 *
 * Somebody already signed in who asks for GitHub is linking it to the account
 * they have, not signing in as somebody else: their Google or email account
 * gains a GitHub identity, and the callback keeps the token that lets them
 * star repositories from here. Linking needs "Manual linking" switched on in
 * Supabase → Authentication → Sign In / Providers.
